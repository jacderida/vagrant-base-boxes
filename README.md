# Vagrant Boxes

This is just a little utility repository for housing boxes I can spin up quickly for experimentation. It would include base boxes, i.e. an operating system with nothing on it, but also any small miscellaneous configurations. For example, there's a box that has an installation of the Travis CLI on it (needs a Ruby environment I didn't want to install on my main development machine).

I find myself creating these things over and over again, so just wanted a place to keep them all.
